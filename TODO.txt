* update readme to point to LWS and provide a simple curl or two to get a web crawl data source added and running

* add facet fields

* make it use /lucid (might require fix to Blacklight to allow a :qt='/lucid' to translate into /solr/collection1/lucid path request)
  - or does LWS allow for qt's like that?
