- Dynamically show search results and document details from Solr response rather than BL fixed config

- data source awareness
  * serve file system crawled files (optional to turn off, warn big in readme/how-to)
  
- Add unit tests for overridden BL functionality (like facets_helper stuff)

- Clean up, trim down BL config in catalog_controller

- Move catalog_controller to browse_controller or something like that... maybe lucid_controller?

- Remove MARC (SolrMarc, etc) stuff

- Fix http://localhost:3000/search_history
